Hello! Because of I do not own the Firefox theme 
and don't want to share the extension files, I wanted 
to create guide instead of sharing my whole profile 
folder. Disadvantage of this is you need to install 
these single by single.
<br/>

## Startpage/Homepage
I use Square Start Page extension for my homepage.
<br/>

## Theme
[FlyingFox](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox)

# Notes
- Yeah, I care about privacy
- NightEye extension is different from others and analyzes site and if website is already dark, it disables itself. (Like magic right?)
- If you want the Tree Style Tab to have a theme like mine, you need to check the Theme section at the above. It's theme guide is on FlyingFox's Wiki page.
- Trocker extension is awesome and works similar to PixelBlock.
